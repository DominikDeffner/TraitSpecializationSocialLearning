# Trait Specialization and Social Learning

This repository contains the scripts to reproduce all results and plots in 

***Deffner & Kandler (submitted):
"TRAIT SPECIALIZATION, INNOVATION AND THE EVOLUTION OF CULTURE IN FLUCTUATING ENVIRONMENTS"***

Description of files:

- "Fig1_VariantsPlot.r" is the code for Fig.1: llustrative  example  of  four  different  adaptation  functions
with  decreasing  levels  of  generalization and illustration of different modes of environmental change

- "SimulationCodeBaselineDynamics.r" contains code to simulate adaptation dynamics after an environmental shock for our baseline model

- "Fig2_TempDynamics.r" lets you plot the corresponding results (Fig. 2 and A1)

- "SimulationCodeLearningOpportunities.r" contains simulation code for Interplay between innovation rate, trait characteristics and learning opportunities

- "Fig3_NLearn.r" lets you reproduce the corresponding figure (Fig. 3)

- "SimulationCodeFixedComparison.r" contains code for comparisons between flexible and fixed specialist/generalist variants as well as analyses of different sources of innovation and fidelity of social learning 

- "Fig4_AdaptPerTime" lets you reproduce Fig. 4, troportion of simulations that reach a given adaptation threshold
conditional on the time since the last change in the environmen

- "Fig5_InnoSourceFidelity.r" contains code for Fig. 5, the comparison of adaptation dynamics for different sources of innovations and degrees of copying error
